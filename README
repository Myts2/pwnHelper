Usage:pwnHelper.py <binary>
Use Ctrl-C to finish record and name the function
If you input a var, you can input the data with defined var name
eg: 111#index
it can create a function var named `index`

And you can find solve.*.py in current folder

Don't use Ctrl-C to close the program, just close the terminal window. #TODO

Have Fun!
